    <h1>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h1>

<br>

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus SARS-CoV-2. The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell. <a href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank">(https://www.who.int/)</a>

<br>
Currently, 70 potential coronavirus vaccines are in development globally according to <a href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>.
